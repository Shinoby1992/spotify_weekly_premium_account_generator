# spotify_weekly_premium_account_generator
Tired of making new spotify accounts everyweek, this will do that for me.

I live in India, so everytime I need to create a new spotify acc I have to use a VPN and and create a fake account and use the premium for 7days.
I'll run this every 7th day and get a new account ready. Moreover I am plannning to add a last account generated thing so that I can import previous playlist into
my new account.
Will start working on this this week.

## How it will work
- Run this script whenever i need a account generated,
